    <blockquote>
     <p>“LBBD is the first local authority in the world to have built a SPI at the level of granularity of the ward. This is an outstanding innovation in the use of the Index that they now plan to scale in the UK. This innovation was an initiative of the council who approached the Imperative having learned about the Index to see if it could be harnessed to support the Borough's Plans. Our experience globally is that such projects require committed local partners who will commit their own resources and want to drive the project. LBBD clearly met this requirement. Their Index has pioneered the use of administrative data with other data to bring the comparative measure of social progress to a local level. LBBD also innovated in data visualisation and is already developing new ways of using the data to support policy and programme design, and for dialogue between the council, residents and stakeholders. We are optimistic that we will see a clear case study of how the Social Progress Index can impact spending and policy decisions to have a real, positive impact on people’s lives. LBBD’s work has even peaked global interest and as a result we fully endorse this application to MHCLG.”</p>

     <p>"the Insight team have taken our ambition of "no-one left behind" and have made it into a very real and useful tool. "No-one left behind" means different things to different stakeholders and what the team have done is captured the very real social issues that we face as a borough and given us a tool to track our progress every year. For me the ease of use is key; data can be a very difficult subject area to understand but what the team has done is create a tool that provides insight in an instant at our own fingertips. As a ward councillor, the ward indexes, yearly comparisons and coloured progress ratings clearly illustrates where our attention and efforts should be for our residents."</p>

     <p>"CU London, a wholly owned educational subsidiary of Coventry University Group, opened it's doors at the fomer Civic Centre in the Borough of Barking and Dagenham in September 2017. The University Group is a high performing one; (TEF Gold rated, Times University of the Year 2019 for student experience, and the highest placed modern university in the Times 'table of tables'), but crucially has a strong reputation for widening participation through it's 'life-shaped' learning model. </p> <p>CU London enrolled nearly 500 students in year 1, and is on track for rapid growth, targeting 1100 students in year 2 (2018-19), to 3500 students by year 6 (2022-23). Key to this is in our work engaging meaningfully with core communities, business and individuals in Barking and Dagenham, which has already won us praise by UPP in their research to identify best practice in universities fulfilling their 'civic' role. To this end, the Data Explorer has already proven invaluable in ensuring that we make the right strategic and operational decisions at the right time, which of course are meaningful enablers of real social inclusion, empowerment and progress. This tool has huge potential and CU London fully supports LBBD’s bid to MHCLG."
